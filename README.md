# Spam Classification in SVM

This project includes the codes I wrote to solve the Spam classification problems in SVM.

To use an SVM to classify emails into spam or non-spam, I first preprocessed the email where I converted the email to be computational friendly and converted the character into numeric value using vocabulary list. This helped me extract features from emails. Then I programmed SVM with gaussian function to classify spam. The traning accuracy is about 99.8% and a test accuracy is about 98.5%.
